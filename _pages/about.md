I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at <a href='https://kma.ac.kr:461/kma/427/subview.do'>Korea Military Academy</a>, and I am also serving in the Republic of Korea Army as a captain.

I received my MS degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href='https://www.tamu.edu/index.html'>Texas A&M University</a> in 2020, and my BS degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href='https://kma.ac.kr:461/kma/427/subview.do'>Korea Military Academy</a> in 2016.

My research interests include radar signal processing, machine learning, optimization, molecular communication, and military communication systems.
